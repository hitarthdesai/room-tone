This is an acoustic simulation project we built in MakeUofT 2022-2023

This project is to be run and used on the Qualcomm Snapdragon HDK.
Using the configured camera, users can scan a room and convert it 
to point-cloud data, which can later be visualized as an interactive
3D map of the room. In the future, we plan to allow people to put in
multiple sources, obstacles, etc to allow for more realistic simulations.

We also worked on building our own (sound) ray tracing algorithm to
map how sound would travel from source to listener, which would eventually
help us to build a sound profile for a room.
